You hire a lawyer to negotiate arrangements for you.\r\n\r\nYou can still hire a lawyer to negotiate on your behalf even if the other person chooses not to use one.\r\n\r\nLawyer negotiation is suitable for people who prefer not to meet because their relationship is still difficult, or because there’s a lack of trust.",
