  "label": "evidence which demonstrates that a prospective party has been, or is at risk of being, the victim of domestic violence by another prospective party in the form of abuse which relates to financial matters, where that evidence dates within the sixty month period immediately preceding the date of the application\r\n\r\nFinancial abuse can take subtle or overt forms but in general includes tactics to limit a prospective party's access to assets, or to conceal information and accessibility to the family finances. Types of evidence, if available, could be\r\nin the following forms: copies of relevant bank statements, and/or cancelled cheques; relevant letters from banks; credit card accounts, loan documents and statements; business financial statements, employee benefit records including insurance, stock options and bonuses; letter from a domestic violence support organisation; money order receipts; documentation with regard to any public assistance received; emails, text messages, diary kept by the victim; letters from employers or from an education or training institute. This list is not exhaustive.\r\n\r\nA single piece of evidence may, or may not, be sufficient, but different pieces of evidence taken together could be sufficient to lead to the conclusion of financial abuse. In some cases of financial abuse, a prospective party may not have access to any forms of corroborating forms of documentary evidence. If there is limited or no such evidence available, then a narrative statement should set out when the financial abuse commenced, its degree, its duration, the impact on the party and an explanation as to why no other documentary evidence is available.\r\n"
