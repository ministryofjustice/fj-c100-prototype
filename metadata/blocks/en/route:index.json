This might mean you won’t get the outcome you’re after.\r\n\r\nIf you’re worried about your or your children’s safety you should continue with this application.\r\n\r\n[Compare alternatives to court]({app:urls:url:cait})\r\n\r\n## Fees\r\n\r\nIt costs £215 to apply. Only the applicant (the person applying to court) needs to pay.\r\n\r\nYou may be able to [get help paying the fee]({app:urls:url:help-with-fees}) if you’re on a low income, receive certain benefits or have little or no savings. Apply online before you start if you think you're eligible.",
