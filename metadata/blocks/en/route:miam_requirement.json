  "xbody": "Before making an application for a child arrangements order, prohibited steps order or specific issue order (a section 8 order) you must  first attend a Mediation, Information and Assessment Meeting (MIAM). At the MIAM an authorised family mediator will consider with you (and the other party if present) whether family mediation, or another form of non-court dispute resolution, would be a more appropriate alternative to court. The mediator will also be able to sign post you to other help and support services.\r\n\r\nYou **must** have attended a MIAM before making this application **unless** the requirement to attend a MIAM does not apply because the section 8 order you are applying for:\r\n\r\n- is for a consent order; **or**\r\n- concerns a child who is the subject of separate ongoing emergency proceedings, care proceedings or\r\nsupervision proceedings (or is already the subject of an emergency, care or supervision order); **or**\r\n- you are exempt from the requirement to attend a MIAM. (Some exemptions you can claim yourself, others must\r\nbe certified by an authorised family mediator).\r\n\r\nAll applicants must complete sections 1 to 12 and complete and sign section 15 of this form.\r\n\r\n**In addition, you must** tick one of the boxes below and ensure that you, your legal adviser or a family mediator completes (and where indicated signs) the relevant section(s) of this form as shown."
